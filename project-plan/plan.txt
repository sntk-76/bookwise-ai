Final Project Plan: BERT-Based Book Recommender System
Goal: Build a smart, natural-language-powered book recommendation app using Sentence-BERT and deploy it on Streamlit Cloud (free tier).

🟩 PHASE 1: DATA COLLECTION & ENRICHMENT
🔹 Step 1: Download the Book Metadata
Use the GoodBooks-10k dataset from Kaggle.

Start with the books.csv file which contains book titles, authors, and ratings.

This will serve as your base dataset — each row is a book to enrich.

🔹 Step 2: Enrich the Dataset with Descriptions
The original dataset does not include book descriptions, which are required for BERT embeddings.

Use the Google Books API to fetch rich, human-readable descriptions:

Query using book title and author.

Extract the description field.

For books with missing results, you may optionally query the Open Library API as a fallback.

Store the final result in a new file (books_enriched.csv) with fields like:

Title, author, description, average rating, genre/tags (if any).

🟩 PHASE 2: TEXT EMBEDDING PREPARATION
🔹 Step 3: Preprocess Descriptions
Clean and normalize descriptions to remove unwanted characters or formatting.

Filter out any books that still have no description (optional).

🔹 Step 4: Generate Sentence-BERT Embeddings (Offline)
Use a lightweight Sentence-BERT model such as all-MiniLM-L6-v2.

Pass each book’s description into the model to generate a vector.

Each book will now have a semantic vector representation (usually 384 dimensions).

Save these embeddings to a file (e.g., .npy, .pkl, or .csv) and keep them linked to their book IDs or titles.

🟩 PHASE 3: BUILDING THE WEB APP INTERFACE
🔹 Step 5: Design the Streamlit UI
Create a Streamlit interface with:

A text input box where users can type what kind of book they want.

A “Get Recommendations” button to trigger the engine.

A display section to show recommended books (title, author, description, cover image if available).

🔹 Step 6: Load Data in the Streamlit App
At app startup:

Load the books_enriched.csv file (metadata).

Load the precomputed BERT embeddings into memory.

(Optional) Cache them for performance.

🟩 PHASE 4: REAL-TIME SEMANTIC SEARCH
🔹 Step 7: Handle User Input at Runtime
When the user enters a description:

Embed it using the same Sentence-BERT model.

Compare the user’s vector with all book vectors using cosine similarity.

🔹 Step 8: Retrieve and Sort Recommendations
Compute similarity scores for each book.

Sort by highest similarity.

Select and return the top N most relevant books (e.g., top 5 or 10).

Display the results in a clean, easy-to-read format in Streamlit.

🟩 PHASE 5: DEPLOYMENT
🔹 Step 9: Prepare for Deployment
Push your app code and all required files (excluding large model weights) to a GitHub repository.

Include:

app.py (main Streamlit app)

Cleaned dataset (books_enriched.csv)

Embedding file (book_vectors.pkl or similar)

requirements.txt (Python libraries)

🔹 Step 10: Deploy to Streamlit Cloud (Free Tier)
Go to https://streamlit.io/cloud

Connect your GitHub account and import your repo.

Select app.py as the main file.

Deploy the app — it will automatically install dependencies and launch.

Share the public app link with others (perfect for your portfolio).

🟩 PHASE 6: (Optional) POLISH & EXTENSIONS
🔹 Step 11: Enhance the UX/UI
Add cover images using the Google Books or Open Library API.

Show genre tags or ratings.

Display similarity scores visually (e.g., progress bars).

Organize results in Streamlit columns for better layout.

🔹 Step 12: Handle Edge Cases
What if the user enters very vague or strange input?

What if the embedding is too generic?

You can add fallback logic:

Show most popular books

Prompt user to rephrase input

🔹 Step 13: Final Touches
Add a professional README with screenshots, features, and tech stack.

Record a demo GIF or video for your portfolio.

Share it on LinkedIn, GitHub, or a personal website.
